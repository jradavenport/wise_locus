SDSS-2MASS-WISE LINE OF SIGHT EXTINCTIONS
-----------------------------------------
Values used in Fig 7 and 8 of Davenport (2014)
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.440.3430D

Each file has columns:
[center wavelength (microns), A_lambda/A_r, error]

The files are organized as follows:
los_0 -- los_9: different longitude stripes limited to within 25deg of Galactic plane.
los_10 -- los_12: latitude bins, but full extent in longitude.

The specific Galactic lon. (l) and (absolute) lat. (b) ranges are:
 file:    0  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12
min l = [45,65, 90,105,125,145,175,184,200,224,  0,  0,  0]
max l = [55,75,100,115,135,155,181,195,210,231,360,360,360]
min b = [ 0, 0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0, 30, 55]
max b = [25,25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 30, 65, 90]

Note the min/max l values are approximate, as each region is actually limited by SEGUE stripe boundaries.

Note I include fits for W3, even though in the paper I only presented W1 and W2. I don't trust these W3 fits/errors, but I include them for completeness.
